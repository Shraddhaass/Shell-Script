#4b.Write a shell script that displays all the links to a file specified as the first argument to the
#script. The second argument, which is optional, can be used to specify in which the search is to
#begin. If this second argument is not present, the search is to begin in the current working
#directory. In either case, the starting directory as well as its subdirectories at all levels must be
#searched. The script need not include error checking.
