#Write a shell script to implement terminal locking (Similar to the lock command). It should
#prompt for the user for a password. After accepting the password entered by the user, it must
#prompt again for the matching password as confirmation and if match occurs, it must lock the
#keyword until a matching password is entered again by the user. Note the Script must be
#written to disregard BREAK, control-D. No time limit need be implemented for the lock
#duration.
